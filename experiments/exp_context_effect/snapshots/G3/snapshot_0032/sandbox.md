# Sandbox — G3 (coord-bank)

Sandbox reset with Phase-2 restart. Persistent free-form memory — use
for observations that don't cleanly fit the Principle Bank.

## Carry-over notes from Phase-1

- All stroke primitives assume a 300x300 canvas and math-coord
  convention (center origin, +y up). If drawing on a different canvas,
  either compose on a fresh 300x300 and paste, or refactor `_to_pixel`
  to accept canvas size.
- `heng.py`, `shu.py`, `pie.py`, `na.py`, `dian.py`, `ti.py` are the
  cleanest bank entries — pure single-line or single-bezier
  definitions. Prefer these as composition primitives.
